                <h2>This week:</h2>
                <p>Recently, Brooks Brothers featured their idea of "shirt and tie perfection". This idea of perfection was far removed from reality. Ghastly purple-on-purple and floridly green shirts met the eye. But in the interests of office-working men and studious, well-dressed students everywhere, we've put together a collection of fantastic dress shirts that will impress your fellow students or your coworkers.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>To start, let's begin with a more conservative outfit. Brooks Brothers Supima cotton has always had a reputation for durability, so it is with pleasure that we pair the <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Supima%C2%AE-Cotton-Non-Iron-Traditional-Fit-Spread-Collar-Broadcloth-Thick-Thin-Check-Dress-Shirt/ME01371,default,pd.html?dwvar_ME01371_Color=LTBL&contentpos=48">Light Blue Supima Cotton Traditional Fit Broadcloth Dress Shirt</a> (what a mouthful) <u>for a mere $46!</u> If that pattern isn't <i>quite</i> your style, try the similarly colored <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Egyptian-Cotton-Slim-Fit-Spread-Collar-Herringbone-Gingham-Luxury-Dress-Shirt/ME01385,default,pd.html?dwvar_ME01385_Color=BLUE&contentpos=2&cgid=Mens_sale_category">Egyptian Cotton, Italian woven Gingham Dress Shirt</a>, <u>for $92.50</u> To match with that fine shirt, let's add the power-worker golden <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Wool-Challis-Dot-Print-Tie/MA01410,default,pd.html?dwvar_MA01410_Color=GOLD&contentpos=44">Challis Dot Print Tie</a>, <u>for $49.25</u>. To match with the tie and the shirt, we can chose either a pair of chinos or a pair of dress slacks. </p>
                   <p>For chinos, we prefer the always reliable Jack Donnelly Dalton Pants <u>($78)</u>. Keep in mind, you'll need to get a tailor to hem the bottom. </p>
                <p>For dress slacks, we return to <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Milano-Fit-Plain-Front-Donegal-Trousers/265J,default,pd.html?dwvar_265J_Color=CHAR&contentpos=6&cgid=1528">Brooks Brothers' Donegal Trousers</a>, <u>half-off for $124</u>. If you prefer a darker pair of trousers, try the <a href="http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Regent-Fit-Plain-Front-Classic-Gabardine-Trousers/188J,default,pd.html?dwvar_188J_Color=BLCK&contentpos=2&cgid=0219">Regent Gabardine Trousers</a> - <u>two for $229</u>. </p>

                        <h4>This week, we featured:</h4>
                        <h3> Brooks Brothers <br> Vineyard Vines <br> Nobby Clothes Shop <br> Leather Man Ltd.</h3>
                        <h4>Fade your reds, bro!</h4>
                        <p>Breaking in Nantucket Reds, but don't have the time to go wading in the frigid waters? Wash them (by themselves, they have a tendency to bleed) in warm water on a short cycle. Don't dry them quite yet! If you have a lobster pot, or something deep enough to fit the pants in comfortably, go ahead and plonk them in a pot of extra hot (as in slightly less than boiling) water, and stir for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, if you really want to. <s>Garnish with salt and pepper. Serves 1.</s> Toss 'em in the dryer, but make sure to fold and iron if need be afterwards - otherwise, nasty creases will appear.</p>
                        <p>If you really want to take things to the next level, you'll need to pair your Reds with a good pair of Sperrys. We personally recommend the Gold Cups ($124.99) as a pair of shoes that last forever, and will carry your feet around in little cloud-like mattresses. But making them look like they've been worn on the beach or on the yacht is no mean task, especially in the winter. That's why there is a <i>very</i> simple recipe, which will make your shoes look great.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Grab a Tupperware large enough to fit your shoes side by side with extra space (a lot of extra space). Add as many liters of water as it takes to completely (totally, 100% completely) submerge your Sperrys. Then, for every liter of water you added, add a tablespoon of salt. <b>Be very conservative with the salt - it can and will strip your Sperrys of the lustrousness that is so very nice.</b> After that's done, leave them in there for about 24 hours. (26.5 hours and 12 seconds will do it). Then, walk around in them (outside, please!) for five or ten minutes. Leave them in your shoe rack. If you have a shoehorn that is suited for your feet, try slipping it in there. If you don't - get a shoehorn.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>After a month, go out and get leather conditioner. Lotuff sells a great <a href="http://lotuffleather.com/products/leather-elixir">magical elixir'</a> that does wonders. ($20) Get two or three - these are serious quality.</p>
